# Decision log

Every design fork — a point where the user chose among researched options —
is recorded here. Format: context, options considered, decision, date,
consequences. Undecided forks are listed as OPEN at the top.

## OPEN forks

(none — F-001..F-011 all decided)

## Decided

### F-006: Error handling — **Result + postfix `?` via Core.Try** (2026-07-19)

**Sub-decision F-006a (user, 2026-07-19): variant naming is `Ok`/`Err`**,
overriding the design README's older Success/Failure spelling; docs and
prelude code use `Core.Result(T, E)` with alternatives `Ok(T)` / `Err(E)`.

Staged B0-B3 per fork/design-sprint/error-handling.md: B0 `--cpp-exceptions`
flag + fenced terminate-at-boundary thunks (zero deps, replaces today's UB);
B1 Core.Result + match (after W4/W5); B2 postfix `?` through an open
Core.Try interface with ImplicitAs error conversion; B3 catching thunks
importing throwing C++ as Result(T, Cpp.Exception) + Carbon::expected
export. Rejected: library-only (fails the milestone bullet), declared
fallibility (2-3x cost, collides with if-let), native exceptions
(contradicts p000301, XL lowering).

### F-007: Unions — **Native `union` declaration** (2026-07-19)

Rust-shaped safety surface (writes safe, reads defined byte-reinterpretation,
trivially-copyable fields in 0.1), C++-compatible layout on the existing
CustomLayoutType machinery, both interop directions. Settles the
overlapping-storage primitive choice payloads (W5) lower onto. Rejected:
Core.Storage primitive only, import-only. Per fork/design-sprint/unions.md.

### F-008: Threading/atomics interop — **Fix the three defects** (2026-07-19)

Memory-model design doc + conformance programs + upstreamable fixes for:
std::thread(carbon_fn) check failure, template-specialization-typed global
link failure, std::atomic<CarbonClass> triviality assert (the last doubles
as the first Carbon-type-into-Clang slice F-010/W8 need). Rejected:
doc-only, Core.Sync veneer, native atomics. Per
fork/design-sprint/threading-atomics.md.

### F-009: Function overloading — **Marked `overload fn`** (2026-07-19)

Closed same-library sets (p000998), declaration-order first-match
(p002875), explicit marker on every member (preserves p003763 typo
diagnostics), no value patterns in 0.1. Exported sets resolve under C++
rules: documented divergence with bidirectional conformance tests.
Rejected: unmarked sets, pattern-dispatch, no-overloading. Per
fork/design-sprint/function-overloading.md.

### F-010: Template structural conformance — **`template constraint` + `require`** (2026-07-19)

Implement accepted p000818/p002200 plus require validity blocks and
boolean predicates via probe-mode evaluation; two-way C++20 concept
mapping; adopts F-009's declaration-order/no-subsumption rule for
constrained candidates. Rejected: Go-style implicit satisfaction,
predicates-only. Per fork/design-sprint/structural-conformance.md.

### F-011: Combined match control flow — **`if (let ...)` + `let ... else`** (2026-07-19)

Positive form `if (let P = e)` (and while-let), negative form
`let P = e else { diverge }` filling p002188's reserved slot; enclosing-
scope bindings; syntactic divergence list in 0.1 (return/break/continue),
type-based noreturn rule deferred to safe-Carbon work. A future `?`
desugars onto this core per F-006. Rejected: is-expression flow scoping,
guard-let, match-only. Per fork/design-sprint/if-let.md.

### F-005: Own-toolchain build environment — **Self-hosted runner** (2026-07-19)

The user registered a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner ("jeromehome",
self-hosted/Linux/X64) on the fork. `.github/workflows/fork_build_toolchain.yaml`
builds `//toolchain/install:carbon_toolchain_tar_gz` from the pushed
branch, runs `bazel test //toolchain/...` as the F-002 merge gate, and
publishes the tarball as a fork release (via a hosted publish job). The
sandbox then downloads that release the same way it downloads the mirrored
nightly. First cold build compiles LLVM (hours); the runner's bazel disk
cache makes subsequent fork builds incremental. Security note: on a public
repo, keep the default "require approval for outside collaborators'
workflow runs" protection enabled so third-party PRs can't run code on the
runner host.

### F-001: What "0.1" means for this fork — **Staged official 0.1** (2026-07-19)

Chase the full official checklist from `docs/project/milestones.md`, in
dependency order, tagging intermediate fork milestones (`fork-0.1-alpha`,
`fork-0.1-beta`, …) as scoreboard tiers go green. Design authorship for
the undesigned bullets is in scope. Alternatives rejected: pragmatic
subset-0.1 (diverges from the official definition), upstream-lockstep
(too slow, not autonomous).

### F-002: Upstream relationship — **Bun-style merge gating** (2026-07-19)

User's words: "Follow the same approach used by the Bun zig->rust rewrite
for merging into my fork branch." Interpretation (recorded for review):
in the Bun rewrite, work happened in isolated worktrees/branches and
merged only after **100% of the pre-existing test suite passed in CI**.
Applied here:

- Feature work happens in child branches/worktrees, never directly on
  `claude/carbon-fork-0-1-7mwfb7`.
- A merge into the fork branch requires the full pre-existing toolchain
  test suite plus the conformance scoreboard to be green (no skipped or
  deleted tests to force a pass).
- Upstream trunk merges are treated the same way: merge upstream into a
  staging branch, re-run the suite, land only when green.

### F-003: First scaled track — **Design sprint + match chain in parallel** (2026-07-19)

After the conformance-harness trial (W1): agent fleets draft the missing
designs (error handling, unions, if-let/let-else, function overloading,
threading/atomics interop; then safe Carbon) with the user reviewing at
each design fork, while the implementation loop grinds
match semantics → choice payloads → std::variant/optional interop against
the harness.

### F-004: Arbiter toolchain source — **Upstream nightly prebuilt** (2026-07-19)

User approved adding `carbon-language/carbon-lang` to the session to
download the nightly prebuilt toolchain tarball (Linux x86_64). This
arbitrates *language behavior* while our fork's tree equals upstream
trunk; it cannot execute fork-local compiler changes — see OPEN F-005.
